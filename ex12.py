# Study Drills

# 1. In Terminal, where you normally run python to run your scripts, 
# type pydoc raw_input.
# Read what it says. If you’re on Windows try python - m pydoc 
# raw_input instead.
# A: It says: "(...) Read a string from standard input. (...)"

# 2. Get out of pydoc by typing q to quit.

# 3. Look online for what the pydoc command does.
# A: From python.org: 
# (https://docs.python.org/2/library/pydoc.html#module-pydoc)
# "The pydoc module automatically generates documentation from Python 
# modules."

# 4. Use pydoc to also read about open, file, os, and sys. 
# It’s alright if you do not understand those; just read through and 
# take notes about interesting things.
# A: So, I insert module and then use it, like with os, to maybe create directories? Most of the stuff I don't understand.
