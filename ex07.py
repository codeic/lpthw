# Study Drills

# 1. Go back through and write a comment on what each line does.
# 2. Read each one backward or out loud to find your errors.
# 3. From now on, when you make mistakes, write down on a piece of paper what 
# kind of mistake you made.
# 4. When you go to the next exercise, look at the last mistakes you made and 
# try not to make them in this new one.
# 5. Remember that everyone makes mistakes. Programmers are like magicians who 
# like everyone to think they are perfect and never wrong, but itâ€™s all an act. 
# They make mistakes all the time.
